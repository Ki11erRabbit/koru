for my text editor I was thinking of exposing only a few low level APIs for editing text.
This includes: moving the cursor(s), placing text at the cursor, adding a cursor, extending the selection(s) at the cursor(s), flipping the leading edge of the cursor(s), search, forward search, reverse search, regex search, saving, reloading, writing, opening, undo/redo, clipboard access, an internal way to cut, copy, and paste
